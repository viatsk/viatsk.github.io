    <h3> Book Review: Walden by Henry David Thoreau </h3>
<p> 26 Mar 2022</p>
<div><p> <p>Before I picked up Walden, I read a bunch of critical reviews that said it was boring. I expected to disagree with these reviewers, but oh boy, they sure were correct!</p>

<p>Who likes this book? Anyone who is doing anything slightly different from what the rest of society does (maybe people who follow veganism, or really avowed anarchists, or anti-natalists). Broadly, I think people who like this probably have some strongly-held concept of moral cleanliness, and maybe believe goodness comes from making sacrifices to conform to this notion. <em>“There can be no black melancholy in him who lives in the midst of nature”</em> - really?</p>

<p>I’ve always thought that the most significant way in which Thoreau was different from others is that he was an abolitionist. I don’t think other unconventional opinions take nearly the same amount of moral courage, nor was his abolitionist stance discussed in Walden itself. For that reason, I find both Walden and it’s fans to be very underwhelming.</p>

<p>I read this book while I was alone in rural thailand. It really made me think about how, as a gainfully employed westerner, I have the same kind of broad social safety net that Thoreau had while living by Walden pond. It was a good reminder about what obnoxiousness looks like from the outside.</p>

<p><strong>Review</strong>: 1/5 stars, I don’t understand what’s special about this</p>
