    <p> I have many interests and hobbies. Generally, I am actively reading 2 or 3 books at a time. This is possible because at least one of the books is typically a textbook, another is some sort of less serious non-fiction, and the third is a fiction book. I turn my attention more infrequently to other texts which I consider to be medium and long-term projects. </p>
    <ul class="none" id="CurrBooks">
        <li>
        <h4> Here are the books I am currently reading: </h4>
        <div><p> To Walk the Night, by William Sloane </p> </div>
        <div> <p> Expert Political Judgement: How Good Is It? How Can We Know? by Philip E. Tetlock </p> </div>
        <div> <p> The Linux Programming Interface, a long-term project so that I can have more complete OS knowledge </p> </div>
        <div><a href="https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/lf-current/index.html"> Software Foundations: Volume 1</a> as part of a reading group with the Computer Science Club at UWaterloo </div>

        <h4> Here are some books that I've recently finished: </h4>
        <div><p>
        Democracy May Not Exist, But We'll Miss It When It's Gone, by Astra Taylor </p> </div>
        <div><p> The Event, by Slavoj Zizek </p> </div>

    <div> <p> Every 6 to 18 months, I will discover a topic that's of intense interest to me and begin to fixate on it. Most recetly, this topic has been interactive theorem provers (like Coq), although I am also interested in learning about the theory behind programming languages in general. I have put together the following diagram of texts which I intend to read over the course of my self-study: </p> </div> 
    <img src="/assets/PLProgression.png" alt="PL Learning Progression">.
    <div> <p> This diagram is admittedly quite ambitious. My confidence in completing it is misguided and stems from the unexpected continuous productivity that I've been experiancing while in quarentine. I am always interested in receiving recommendations for additional texts, courses (if freely avalible), and other material to learn from. At the end of the day, I am looking to teach myself the equivalent of the UW courses CS 245E (auditing F2020), CS 365, and some of CS 462, CS 442, CS 444. Since I am graduating soon and in an entirely different faculty, I will likely not get the opportunity to take these courses myself &#128557. </p></div>
    <p> Previous topics of interest to me have been: </p>
    <ul class = "bullet">
        <li> Digital Hardware Design and HDLs </li>
        <li> Systems programming </li>
        <li> Graph Theory </li>
        <li> Material Science, specifically as it relates to transistors</li>
        <li> Biochemistry and Neuroscience (back in high school) </li>
