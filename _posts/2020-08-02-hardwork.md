title: Jekyll go brrrrr

Today I wrote some functioning(?) software, and I feel ok about myself. 

My TODOs for this page are:
1. Make full set of markdown features work (update default stylesheet?) so I can blog about programming. Priority is code markup with relevant syntax highlighting, but block quotes and tables are also useful
2. Integrate latex equations, so I can blog about maths 
3. Figure out how to add SQL database; make interactive "library" section 
4. Different font for blog post, headings, timestamps, navigation bar (as of writing this, I am only using one font everywhere)
