Here we're going to try messing around with some markdown-specific features 
Lets try a blockquote:
> This is the first level of quoting.
>
> > This is nested blockquote.
>
> Back to the first level.

Ok. 

> This is a list inside block quotes:
> 1.   This is the first list item.
> 2.   This is the second list item.
> 
> Here's some example code:
> 
>     return shell_exec("echo $input | $markdown_script");

*single asterisks*

_single underscores_

**double asterisks**

__double underscores__

HERE IS A TABLE?? 
| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

Here is a json to test what syntax highlighting does 

```json
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "age": 25
}
```
Ok, no tables and no syntax highlighing. Okay for now.
