A couple of months ago (around April of this year) COBOL was in the news again. Of course, instead of studying for my exams, I decided to teach myself the language. 

Consider this simple "Hello World" program: 
{% highlight cobol %}
IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
PROGRAM-ID. HELLO.

PROCEDURE DIVISION.
    DISPLAY 'HELLO WORLD'
    STOP RUN.
{% endhighlight %}
