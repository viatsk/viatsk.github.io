    <p> Hello! Welcome to my garden, where I plant the seeds of my ideas. Currently this blog is not very populated, but that's something that I am going to work on! </p>
    <p> I'd like to dedicate more of my free time to essays in which I develop ideas I've had for a long time, and to writing reviews of all the books I've read. </p>
    <p> Otherwise, some future topics may include: </p> 
    <ul class="bullet">
        <li> COBOL 101: Everything you need to make a B+ tree </li>
        <li> Coq tactics and their uses </li>
        <li> Understanding the Curry-Howard correspondence </li>
        <li> Understanding NoSQL Databases </li>
    </ul>
  </main>
